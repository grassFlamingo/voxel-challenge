## Introduction

This is my voxel for taichi 2022 voxel challenge.

There is a small bug in my device. I cannot run vulkan. 
In order to run the codes, `ti.ui.Window` is replaced by `ti.GUI`. 
I wish that this is not against the rules.


## Installation

Make sure your `pip` is up-to-date:

```bash
pip3 install pip --upgrade
```

Assume you have a Python 3 environment, simply run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

to install the dependencies of the voxel renderer.

## Quickstart

```sh
python3 example1.py  # example2/3/.../7/8.py
```

Mouse and keyboard interface:

+ Drag with your left mouse button to rotate the camera.
+ Press `W/A/S/D/Q/E` to move the camera.
+ Press `P` to save a screenshot.
